# Weather App created in vanilla JavaScript

API used for weather app is taken from https://www.weatherapi.com/.

You can preview the web page here: https://www.davorj94.io/weather-app-javascript/.

This whole project is based on the API and not on the styling of the page. Therefore, simplistic styling is created and icons based on the current weather (or forecasted) is taken as the link provided in the API.

Additional functionality, like mph and kph, as well as degrees celsius or fahrenheit are added for end users to decide which unit fits best their needs.

Also, a message is displayed and nothing is basically shown until user shares his/her location.
